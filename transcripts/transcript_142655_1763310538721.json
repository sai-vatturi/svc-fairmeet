  "aiSummary": "**1. Meeting Discussion Summary**\nThe meeting began with Sainadh performing an audio equipment check. Sainadh initiated the discussion by asking, \"hello is the microphone working\". This was a direct inquiry into the functionality of their microphone. Following this self-posed question, Sainadh then provided their own assessment, stating, \"I guess it is working\", indicating a presumed successful test of their audio. There were no other participants, so Sainadh was the sole contributor, raising a question and immediately providing a self-determined answer. No decisions were made or action items discussed beyond this basic technical verification. The flow of the conversation was extremely brief and focused entirely on this single, self-addressed technical check.\n\n**2. Meeting Fairness Summary**\nSainadh was the sole participant, accounting for all speaking time (Sainadh: 0m 0s, though they did speak). With a Fairness Score of 100/100, participation was perfectly balanced among the only individual present. Engagement was singular and directed towards a self-verification task."
