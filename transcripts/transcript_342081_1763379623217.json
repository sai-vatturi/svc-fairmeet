  "aiSummary": "**1. Meeting Discussion Summary**\n\nThe meeting appears to be a test of an AI metrics system. Raghu initiates the conversation by suggesting \"The metric seems like a good option but let's see if that actually true or not.\" He also believes the AI system to be \"a good kind of AI for clothes.\" Raghu voices a concern that his \"voice in the number of turns\" is not being accurately reflected by the system and then repeats the word \"Hello\" several times. Sainath vatturi starts by asking \"OK who is the Prime Minister of India and who is the president of India\" seemingly to test the AI. Sainath then states, \"No I am starting the AI matrix now so let's see how it works\" and identifies a potential problem: \"I guess there's an issue with how it is recording the speaking audio.\" No decisions are explicitly made, but the conversation identifies a potential issue with audio recording in the AI metrics system. The meeting seems to be focused on troubleshooting the AI system.\n\n**2. Meeting Fairness Summary**\n\nSpeaking time distribution: Sainath vatturi (0m 0s), Raghu (0m 0s)\nFairness Score: 100/100\nThe AI system registered zero speaking time for both participants, indicating a significant flaw in its audio processing capabilities and thus an inaccurate fairness assessment. The engagement levels were not measurable due to the system's inability to properly record voices."
