  "aiSummary": "**1. Meeting Discussion Summary**\n\nThe meeting was essentially a sound and video check conducted by Sainath vatturi. Sainath was primarily focused on verifying the functionality of the transcription service, noting that he had “turned off the microphone symbols.” He repeats this statement multiple times throughout the brief recording, demonstrating his primary concern with the microphone input and transcription accuracy. He also confirmed that he had turned on his video. There were no questions raised that required answers, no decisions made, and no action items discussed beyond verifying the system setup. The flow of the \"conversation\" was repetitive, consisting solely of Sainath vatturi checking the audio and video recording. He also apologized, stating \"sorry I'm talking to him so yeah,\" suggesting he was addressing someone else off-screen while testing the setup.\n\n**2. Meeting Fairness Summary**\n\nSpeaking time was entirely dominated by Sainath vatturi (0m 0s), who was solely focused on system checks. Fairness Score: 100/100. While only one person spoke, the meeting was designed for an individual check and not collaborative discussion, resulting in a high fairness score given the context."
