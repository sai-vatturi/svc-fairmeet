  "aiSummary": "**Meeting Summary: Participation and Engagement Analysis**\n\nThis meeting, lasting 0 minutes, recorded no verbal participation from either of the two attendees, Sainadh and Raghu. Both participants registered 0 minutes and 0 turns of speaking time.\n\nConsequently, engagement levels were non-existent, as no conversation or interaction occurred. While the fairness metrics (Fairness Score: 100/100, Gini Coefficient: 0.00, Participation Entropy: 0.00) reflect perfect equality, this is due to the complete absence of any speaking rather than an equitable distribution of conversational turns.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n*   **Engagement:** Extremely low (zero).\n*   **Participation:** Non-existent, with no turns taken by either participant.\n*   **Fairness:** Perfect *by default* due to the lack of any speaking activity."
