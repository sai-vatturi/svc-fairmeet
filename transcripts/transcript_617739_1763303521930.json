  "aiSummary": "## Meeting Summary\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThis meeting involved two participants, Sainadh and Raghu. However, based on the data, no discussion occurred as both participants had zero recorded speaking time.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   There was no verbal contribution from either Sainadh or Raghu during the allotted meeting duration.\n*   The meeting appears to have been either very short, silent, or there were technical issues preventing audio capture.\n\n**Fairness Analysis:**\n\nThe fairness metrics indicate a perfect distribution of speaking time (or rather, lack thereof), with a fairness score of 100/100, a Gini coefficient of 0.00, and participation entropy of 0.00. This is a direct consequence of neither participant speaking.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Investigate Technical Issues:** If the meeting was intended to have active participation, verify the functionality of the audio recording system and participant microphones.\n*   **Clarify Meeting Objectives:** Ensure participants are clear on the purpose of future meetings and are prepared to contribute. Pre-circulating an agenda can facilitate this.\n*   **Encourage Participation:** In future meetings, actively solicit input from all participants to foster a more collaborative environment."
